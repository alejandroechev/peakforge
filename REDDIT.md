**Title:** I built a free browser-based spectroscopy peak fitting tool — Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt profiles

**Body:**

If you do Raman, FTIR, or XPS and need to deconvolve overlapping peaks, I built PeakForge — a free web app for spectroscopy peak fitting. It does baseline correction, automatic peak detection, and simultaneous multi-peak fitting with Gaussian, Lorentzian, and pseudo-Voigt profiles.

Uses Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to fit all peaks simultaneously. Reports center, height, width, area, and R² for each peak.

No OriginPro license needed. No install, no login, runs entirely in your browser.

Would love feedback from spectroscopists — what features would make this useful for your data?

## Post 2: r/spectroscopy

**Title:** Free browser tool for peak deconvolution — multi-peak Gaussian/Lorentzian/Voigt fitting with auto-detection

**Body:**

Built a free, open-source web tool for spectroscopy peak fitting. It handles baseline correction, peak detection via local maxima with prominence filtering, and multi-peak fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt.

Supports Gaussian, Lorentzian, and pseudo-Voigt profiles. Fit parameters are adjustable, and you can add/remove peaks manually. All client-side — your data never leaves your machine.

What would spectroscopists need? Batch processing? Custom line shapes? Let me know.

## Post 3: r/physics

**Title:** Free spectroscopy peak fitting tool — Gaussian/Lorentzian/Voigt deconvolution in your browser

**Body:**

I built a free browser-based peak fitting tool for spectroscopy data. Automatic peak detection, baseline correction, and simultaneous multi-peak fitting with Gaussian, Lorentzian, or pseudo-Voigt profiles.

No OriginPro, no MATLAB, no install. Open source and runs client-side.

Feedback welcome from anyone doing spectral analysis — what would make this worth using?
